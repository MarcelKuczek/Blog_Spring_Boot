This project is a Spring Boot application designed for browsing, adding, deleting, and editing blog posts. It is a continuation of an earlier version built with a JavaFX GUI, which served as a foundation for developing this more robust backend-focused application. The application utilizes SQL databases, which I learned and mastered during my studies.

In developing this application, I prioritize clean and readable code, following best practices and utilizing appropriate design patterns to ensure efficiency and maintainability. Each main feature is thoroughly documented, making the codebase organized and accessible for further development.

In the future, there are plans to add OAuth2 login functionality for users publishing posts to enhance security and ease of use.
